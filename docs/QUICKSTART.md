# AI Live Log Bridge - Quick Start Guide

**Stop copying and pasting logs. Give your AI complete visibility into your development environment.**

This guide will get you up and running in 5 minutes.

---

## What Does This Do?

AI Live Log Bridge gives your AI assistant **automatic access** to:
- ✅ Terminal output from commands you run
- ✅ Browser console logs from localhost pages
- ✅ Network requests (fetch, XHR)
- ✅ JavaScript errors with stack traces

**No more "can you check the terminal?" or "what does the console say?"**

---

## Part 1: Terminal Monitoring (Required)

### Step 1: Install

```bash
npm install -g ai-live-log-bridge
```

### Step 2: Configure Your AI Tool

Pick your AI tool and add the MCP configuration:

#### Claude Desktop

Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ai-live-log-bridge": {
      "command": "ai",
      "args": ["--server"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Restart Claude Desktop completely.**

#### Cursor

Settings → Features → Model Context Protocol:

```json
{
  "ai-live-log-bridge": {
    "command": "ai",
    "args": ["--server"]
  }
}
```

**Restart Cursor.**

#### Windsurf

Navigate to MCP configuration in settings:

```json
{
  "ai-live-log-bridge": {
    "command": "ai",
    "args": ["--server"]
  }
}
```

**Restart Windsurf.**

### Step 3: Use It!

**CRITICAL:** Always run terminal commands with the `ai` wrapper:

```bash
# ❌ WRONG - AI can't see this
npm test

# ✅ CORRECT - AI can read the output automatically
ai npm test
```

**Examples:**
```bash
ai npm run dev
ai npm test
ai python manage.py runserver
ai docker-compose up
ai go run main.go
```

### Step 4: Verify It Works

1. Run a command with `ai`:
   ```bash
   ai echo "Hello AI"
   ```

2. Ask your AI:
   ```
   What's in the terminal logs?
   ```

3. Your AI should respond with the output automatically - no copy-pasting!

---

## Part 2: Browser Monitoring (Optional but Powerful)

This lets your AI see browser console logs and network requests from localhost.

**Installation Guide:** See [Browser Extension Setup](BROWSER_EXTENSION_SETUP.md) for complete instructions.

**Extension Repository:** [ai-live-log-bridge-extension](https://github.com/Ami3466/ai-live-log-bridge-extension)

**Quick Summary:**
1. Install the Chrome extension from the repository
2. Configure native messaging host
3. Test on localhost pages

Your AI will be able to automatically see browser console logs and network requests!

## How To Use

### For Terminal Commands

**Always use `ai` wrapper:**
```bash
ai npm test          # AI sees test results
ai npm run build     # AI sees build output
ai npm start         # AI sees server logs
```

### Ask Your AI

Your AI now has these MCP tools available:

**Terminal Tools:**
- `view_logs` - See all recent terminal output
- `get_crash_context` - See only errors and crashes
- `auto_fix_errors` - Detect and analyze all errors automatically
- `get_usage_instructions` - Get help using the system

**Browser Tools** (if extension installed):
- `view_browser_logs` - See console logs and network requests
- `get_browser_errors` - See only browser errors and failed requests
- `get_browser_instructions` - Get help with browser setup

### Example Workflows

**Debugging a test failure:**
```bash
# You run:
ai npm test

# You ask:
"The tests failed. Can you auto-fix the errors?"

# AI calls: auto_fix_errors
# AI responds with specific fixes for each failure
```

**Debugging a frontend bug:**
```bash
# You run:
ai npm run dev

# You open localhost:3000 in Chrome, click a button, error occurs

# You ask:
"The login button isn't working"

# AI calls: view_browser_logs and view_logs
# AI sees both frontend and backend errors
# AI provides complete diagnosis
```

**Hidden terminal problem:**
```bash
# AI runs something in background:
ai npm run dev

# You try to start your app:
npm start  # Error: EADDRINUSE port 3000

# You ask:
"What's running on port 3000?"

# AI calls: view_logs
# AI responds: "Your dev server is running on port 3000 (started 5 minutes ago)"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Terminal: "ai: command not found"

**Solution:** Restart your terminal or run:
```bash
hash -r    # Bash/Zsh
rehash     # Fish
```

### Terminal: AI can't see my logs

**Problem:** You forgot to use `ai` wrapper

**Solution:** Always prefix commands with `ai`:
```bash
ai npm test  # ✅ Logged
npm test     # ❌ Not logged
```

### Browser: Extension issues

For all browser extension troubleshooting, see the [Browser Extension Setup Guide](BROWSER_EXTENSION_SETUP.md).

---

## Configuration

### Log Retention

Control how long logs are kept using `AI_KEEP_LOGS` environment variable:

```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc, ~/.bashrc, or ~/.config/fish/config.fish

# Delete logs immediately when command completes (cleanest)
export AI_KEEP_LOGS=0

# Keep logs for 1 day (default)
export AI_KEEP_LOGS=1

# Keep logs for 7 days
export AI_KEEP_LOGS=7
```

**Recommendation:** Use `AI_KEEP_LOGS=0` for cleanest AI experience (only shows live/running commands).

---

## Security

### What's Monitored?

**Terminal:**
- ✅ All commands run with `ai` wrapper
- ❌ Commands run without `ai` are NOT logged

**Browser:**
- ✅ `localhost:*` pages only
- ✅ `127.0.0.1:*` pages only
- ❌ Regular websites (google.com, etc.) are NOT monitored

### Secret Redaction

Secrets are **automatically redacted** before writing to logs:

**Terminal patterns:**
- API keys (AWS, OpenAI, Stripe, etc.)
- Bearer tokens, JWT tokens
- Passwords in database URLs
- Private keys (PEM, SSH)
- Credit card numbers

**Browser patterns:**
- Cookies
- Authorization headers
- localStorage/sessionStorage tokens
- Session IDs

**How it works:**
- Your terminal shows real output
- Logs contain `[REDACTED]`
- AI never sees your secrets

---

## Manual Log Access

You can view logs manually anytime:

**Terminal logs:**
```bash
# Active/running commands
ls ~/.mcp-logs/active/
cat ~/.mcp-logs/active/session-*.log

# Completed commands (if retention > 0)
ls ~/.mcp-logs/inactive/
cat ~/.mcp-logs/inactive/session-*.log
```

**Browser logs:**
```bash
# Active browser sessions
ls ~/.mcp-logs/browser/active/
cat ~/.mcp-logs/browser/active/browser-*.log

# Completed sessions
ls ~/.mcp-logs/browser/inactive/
cat ~/.mcp-logs/browser/inactive/browser-*.log
```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Start using `ai` for all commands** - It becomes second nature quickly
2. **Install browser extension** - Doubles your debugging power
3. **Try auto_fix_errors** - Let AI analyze all errors at once
4. **Set log retention** - `AI_KEEP_LOGS=0` for cleanest experience
