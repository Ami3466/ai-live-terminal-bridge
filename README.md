# AI Live Log Bridge

**Give your AI complete visibility into your development environment - terminal AND browser.**

A bridge between AI coding assistants and your live logs. Monitor terminal commands, browser console logs, and network requests automatically.

---

## The Problem

Modern AI coding creates a "Split Brain" development experience. You work in one environment, the AI works in another, and neither side can clearly see what the other is doing.

### 1. The AI is Blind to Your Terminal

When you run code in your main terminal, the AI has zero visibility.

It cannot see your server logs, runtime errors, or test failures.

**The Pain:** You are forced into a loop of manual copy-pasting just to give the AI eyes.

### 2. You are Blind to the AI's Terminal

AI tools often execute commands in hidden tabs, cramped side panes, or background threads.

It is hard to follow the live execution, catch warnings, or see the full colored output.

**The Pain:** You lose control of your environment because you can't easily monitor what the AI is actually running.

### 3. The AI is Blind to Your Browser

When debugging frontend issues, the AI cannot see browser console errors, network failures, or JavaScript exceptions.

You must manually open DevTools (F12), switch between Console and Network tabs, and copy-paste everything.

**The Pain:** Frontend debugging becomes a multi-step manual process: check console → copy error → check network → copy request → check server logs → copy again.

### 4. The Broken Feedback Loop

Because of these blind spots, the AI blindly assumes its code works as long as the syntax is correct.

It marks tasks as "Fixed" while your local server is crashing or your browser is throwing errors.

**The Pain:** You are the only one checking reality, manually bridging the gap between three disconnected worlds: your terminal, the AI's terminal, and your browser.

## The Solution

**AI Live Log Bridge** creates automatic visibility into BOTH your terminal AND browser:

### Terminal Monitoring
- Wrap commands with `ai npm test` - everything gets logged
- AI reads logs automatically via MCP tools
- No more copy-pasting terminal output

### Browser Monitoring
- Chrome extension captures console logs automatically
- Network requests monitored in real-time
- AI reads browser errors directly
- **No more copy-pasting from F12 DevTools**

### Unified AI Debugging
```
You: "Login button doesn't work"

AI: [Calls view_browser_logs]
    [Calls view_logs]

AI: "I see three issues:
1. Frontend: TypeError at UserProfile.jsx:42
2. Network: POST /api/login → 401
3. Backend: Authentication token expired

Here's the complete fix..."
```

**No scrolling. No copy-pasting. AI sees everything.**

## MCP Setup

### Claude Desktop

Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ai-live-log-bridge": {
      "command": "ai",
      "args": ["--server"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. **That's it!**

### Cursor

Open Settings > Features > Model Context Protocol, add:

```json
{
  "ai-live-log-bridge": {
    "command": "ai",
    "args": ["--server"]
  }
}
```

Restart Cursor.

### Windsurf

Navigate to MCP configuration in settings, add:

```json
{
  "ai-live-log-bridge": {
    "command": "ai",
    "args": ["--server"]
  }
}
```

Restart Windsurf.

### Other AI Tools

Works with any tool that supports MCP (Model Context Protocol).

For tools without MCP support (Aider, Continue, etc.), see [CLI Mode](#cli-mode) below.

## Browser Setup

> **Note:** Chrome Web Store submission in progress. Once approved, this will be simplified to a single click!

### Current Setup (Manual - Temporary)

**Step 1: Install Native Messaging Host**

```bash
npm run install-native-host
```

**Step 2: Load Chrome Extension**

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT place this project on your Desktop. Chrome blocks extensions from Desktop for security reasons. Keep it in Documents, Projects, or another non-Desktop location.

1. Open Chrome: `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in top right)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the `extension` folder from this project (e.g., `/Users/yourname/Projects/ai-live-log-bridge/extension`)
5. Extension loads ✅

**Step 3: Configure Extension ID**

⚠️ **CRITICAL STEP** - Chrome will block the extension if this isn't done correctly!

```bash
# 1. Get your Extension ID from chrome://extensions/
#    It's the 32-character string under the extension name
#    Example: mgnfhhihoknkoomfinmldenmmglebmha

# 2. Run this command with YOUR extension ID:
npm run update-extension-id <YOUR_EXTENSION_ID>

# 3. RESTART CHROME COMPLETELY (quit and reopen)
```

**Important Notes:**
- ⚠️ **Every time you reload the extension**, Chrome may generate a new ID
- ⚠️ If you see "Access to the specified native messaging host is forbidden", re-run `update-extension-id` with the new ID
- ⚠️ Always restart Chrome completely after updating the ID (not just reload the page)

### Future Setup (After Chrome Web Store Approval)

**This is what setup will look like soon:**

```bash
# 1. Install npm package
npm install -g ai-live-log-bridge

# 2. Install native host (already knows the extension ID!)
npm run install-native-host

# 3. Install extension from Chrome Web Store
# Just click: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/[coming-soon]
# Done!
```

No copying extension IDs. No manual configuration. Just install and go!

---

### Test It

```bash
# Start dev server
ai npm run dev

# Open localhost:3000 in Chrome
# Open DevTools (F12), run:
console.log('Test message');
console.error('Test error');

# Ask AI:
"Check the browser console for errors"

# AI calls get_browser_errors tool
# AI sees everything - no copy-paste needed!
```

---

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Test Failures

**Before:**
```bash
npm test
# 15 tests fail
# You scroll, copy first error
# AI asks for more context
# You copy more errors
# AI asks about line 47
# Repeat...
```

**After:**
```bash
ai npm test
# 15 tests fail

You: "Auto fix this"
AI: [Calls auto_fix_errors]
AI: "Found 15 test failures:
1. TypeError at user.test.ts:42 - Add null check
2. ReferenceError at api.test.ts:15 - Import mockData
3. Port 3000 EADDRINUSE - Kill existing process
[...and 12 more with specific fixes]

Would you like me to apply these fixes?"
```

No scrolling. No copy-pasting. AI sees ALL errors at once.

### Example 2: Frontend Bug

**Before:**
```
You: "Login button doesn't work"
AI: "Check the browser console"
You: [F12, copies] "TypeError: Cannot read property 'id'"
AI: "Check the network tab"
You: [Network, copies] "POST /api/login → 401"
AI: "Check server logs"
You: [Terminal, scrolls, copies] "Invalid token"
```

**After:**
```
You: "Login button doesn't work"

AI: [Calls view_browser_logs]
    [Calls view_logs]

AI: "I see the complete picture:
- Frontend: TypeError at UserProfile.jsx:42 (missing null check)
- Network: POST /api/login → 401 Unauthorized
- Backend: Authentication token expired

Here's the fix for all three layers..."
```

**AI sees terminal AND browser. Instantly.**

### Example 3: Hidden Terminal Problem

**Before:**
```
# Claude Code runs in hidden terminal
npm run dev

# You try to run your app
npm start
# Error: EADDRINUSE port 3000

# You have no idea what's running
# AI can't see the hidden terminal
```

**After:**
```
# Run with ai wrapper
ai npm run dev

You: "What's on port 3000?"
AI: [Calls view_logs]
AI: "Your dev server is running on port 3000 (started 2 minutes ago)"
```

## How It Works

### Terminal Flow
```
You run: ai npm run dev
       ↓
Terminal shows full output (colors preserved)
       ↓
Session isolation: unique session ID
       ↓
Secret redaction: API_KEY=sk-xxx → [REDACTED]
       ↓
Logs written to: ~/.mcp-logs/active/session-<id>.log
       ↓
AI reads via: view_logs / auto_fix_errors / get_crash_context tools
```

### Browser Flow
```
You open: localhost:3000 in Chrome
       ↓
Extension captures: console logs, network requests, errors
       ↓
Sent to: Native messaging host (Node.js)
       ↓
Secret redaction: Cookies/tokens → [REDACTED]
       ↓
Logs written to: ~/.mcp-logs/browser/active/browser-<id>.log
       ↓
AI reads via: view_browser_logs / get_browser_errors tools
```

---

## Configuration

### Log Retention

Control how long logs are kept using `AI_KEEP_LOGS` environment variable (in days):

```bash
# Delete logs immediately when command completes (cleanest)
export AI_KEEP_LOGS=0

# Keep logs for 1 day (default)
export AI_KEEP_LOGS=1

# Keep logs for 7 days
export AI_KEEP_LOGS=7

# Keep logs for 30 days
export AI_KEEP_LOGS=30
```

**Why control retention?**
- `AI_KEEP_LOGS=0`: AI only sees live/running commands (cleanest, recommended for LLMs)
- `AI_KEEP_LOGS=1`: Keep recent logs for debugging (balanced, default)
- `AI_KEEP_LOGS=7+`: Keep logs longer for audit trails

---

## CLI Mode (For Non-MCP Tools)

If your AI tool doesn't support MCP (Aider, Continue, older tools), use CLI mode:

### Setup

Create `.prompts/ai-wrapper.md` (or `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, etc.):

```markdown
# Terminal Command Rules

Always run terminal commands using the `ai` wrapper.

Format: ai <command>

Examples:
- ai npm test
- ai npm start
- ai python script.py

When debugging, run `ai --last 200` to see recent output.
```

### Usage

```bash
# Run commands with ai wrapper
ai npm test

# AI manually reads logs
ai --last 100

# Watch live in another terminal
ai live
```

**MCP mode is recommended** - automatic, faster, more powerful.

## Security Features

### Secret Redaction

**Terminal patterns (15+):**
- API keys: AWS, GitHub, OpenAI, Anthropic, Stripe
- Tokens: Bearer, JWT, session tokens
- Passwords: Database URLs, export statements
- Private keys: PEM, OpenSSH
- Credit cards: Basic validation

**Browser patterns (12+):**
- Cookies: Session IDs, auth cookies
- Headers: Authorization, X-API-Key, Set-Cookie
- Storage: localStorage/sessionStorage tokens
- JSON responses: access_token, refresh_token
- Session IDs: PHPSESSID, JSESSIONID

**How it works:**
- Secrets redacted BEFORE writing to logs
- Your terminal shows real output
- Logs contain `[REDACTED]`
- Secrets never reach AI models

### Session Isolation

- Each terminal command → unique session ID
- Each browser session → unique session ID
- Parallel commands don't interleave
- Clean, organized logs per task

### Project-Based Filtering

- Logs filtered by project directory (`process.cwd()`)
- AI only sees logs from current project
- No cross-project contamination

---

## Troubleshooting

### `ai: command not found`

Restart terminal:
```bash
hash -r   # Bash/Zsh
rehash    # Fish
```

### MCP tools not showing up

1. Check JSON syntax in config
2. Run `which ai` to verify installation
3. Test: `ai --server` should start without errors
4. Restart AI tool completely

### Extension not connecting

1. Verify native host installed: `npm run install-native-host`
2. Check extension ID matches manifest
3. Refresh localhost page
4. Check extension service worker console (chrome://extensions/)

### No browser logs appearing

1. Make sure you're on a **localhost** page
2. Extension only monitors `localhost:*` and `127.0.0.1:*`
3. Check extension enabled in chrome://extensions/
4. Try: `cat ~/.mcp-logs/browser/active/*.log`

---

## FAQ

### Does this slow down my commands?

No. Overhead is less than 1ms. Commands run at full speed.

### Can I see the logs manually?

Yes:
```bash
# Terminal logs
ls ~/.mcp-logs/active/
cat ~/.mcp-logs/active/session-*.log

# Browser logs
ls ~/.mcp-logs/browser/active/
cat ~/.mcp-logs/browser/active/browser-*.log

# View all recent (terminal and browser)
ai --last 100
```

### What if I forget to use `ai`?

Commands still work, just won't be logged. AI won't be able to read output.

### Does browser monitoring work on all sites?

**No - development sites only** (by design, for security):
- ✅ `localhost:3000`, `localhost:8080`, etc.
- ✅ `127.0.0.1:*`
- ✅ `https://*.ngrok.io` (ngrok tunnels)
- ✅ `https://*.ngrok-free.app` (ngrok free)
- ✅ `https://*.loca.lt` (localtunnel)
- ✅ `https://*.trycloudflare.com` (Cloudflare Tunnel)
- ❌ Regular websites (google.com, github.com, etc.)
- ❌ Production sites

This prevents the extension from tracking your general browsing while supporting common development workflows like ngrok for mobile testing, webhook testing, and sharing with teammates.

**Want to add custom domains?** See [Custom Domains Guide](docs/guides/custom-domains.md) for instructions on adding staging environments, Vercel/Netlify previews, or other tunnel services.

### Does this work with Docker?

Yes. `ai docker-compose up`, `ai docker run`, etc. all work.

### Can other AI tools use this?

Yes!
- **MCP Mode:** Any AI supporting Model Context Protocol
- **CLI Mode:** Any AI with terminal access

Works with: Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Aider, Continue, ChatGPT with code interpreter, and more.

### What about CI/CD?

This is designed for local development. In CI, use native logging.
